## Project Overview

This project contains the mechanical design of a quadcopter drone frame, modeled as a complete assembly with individual components and detailed 2D technical drawings.

**Design Features:**
- Modular arm and main frame architecture for easy maintenance
- Central controller unit with protective cover plate
- Side covers for electronics protection and cable management
- Landing stands for ground clearance and stability
- Fully itemized bill of materials (BOM) for fabrication and assembly

**Use Cases:**
- CAD/Mechanical design portfolio showcase
- Teaching resource for assembly modeling
- Drone product concept development
- Practice for technical drawing standards (GOST/ЕСКД compatible)

## How to Use

### 1. Explore the CAD Assembly
1. Download/open the main assembly file in SolidWorks
2. Inspect sub-assemblies, mates, and component relationships
3. Test motion 

### 2. Use the Technical Drawings
1. Open `drawings.pdf`
2. Review assembly views, dimensions, and BOM item numbers
3. Use for manufacturing, quoting, or assembly instructions

**Drawing highlights:**
- Multiple orthographic views (including View B)
- Detailed dimensions and annotations
- Through holes and critical features marked
- BOM fully integrated with item balloons
